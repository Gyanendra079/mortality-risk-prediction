# ðŸ©º Mortality Risk Prediction Web App

This project uses Flask and Dash to predict patient mortality risk based on health and socioeconomic data.

## Features
- Flask-based backend model
- Interactive Dash dashboard for predictions
- Model trained and saved in Google Colab

## Files
- `app.py`: Flask API version
- `dash_app.py`: Dash web UI
- `models/`: Pickle files for model and preprocessor
- `Mortality_Risk_Model.ipynb`: Notebook used for model training

### Tools and Technologies

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, XGBoost, LightGBM,
TensorFlow/Keras (for neural networks), SHAP, LIME.
* Frameworks for Deployment: Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, Dash.

## Potential Challenges
